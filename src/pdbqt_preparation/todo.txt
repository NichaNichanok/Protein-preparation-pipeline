PDBFixer: 

Introdustion 

PDB files often have a number of problems that must be fixed 
before they can be used in a molecular dynamics simulation. 
The details vary depending on how the file was generated:

1. If the sstructure was genearated by X-ray crystallography,
most or all the hydrogen atoms will usually be missing.

2. There may also be missing heavy atoms in flexible regions 
that could not be clearly resolved from the electron density. 
This may include anything from a few atoms at the end of a 
sidechain to entire loops.

3. Many PDB files are also missing terminal atoms that should
be present at the ends of chains.

4. The file may include nonstandard residues that were added
for crystallography purposes, but are not present in the 
naturally occuring molecule you want to simulate.

5. The file may include more than what you want to simulate. 
For example, there may be salts, ligands or other molecules
that were added for experimental purposes, but you only want 
simulate a single copy.

6. There may be multiple locations listed for some atoms.

7. If you want to simulate the structure in explicit solvent,
you will need to add a water box surrounding it.

8. For membrane proteins, you may als need to add a lipid membrane.

PDBFixer can fix all of these problems for you in a fully automated way.

How to use PDBFixer on CLI?

pdbfixer --pdbid=6o0k --add-residues --ph=7.4 --verbose 
--keep-heterogens=none  --output=pdbfixer_74_keep_none.pdb

- You can use the PDBFixer to download/ retrive the PDB file from the RCBS website!
- Also to stripp all the non-protein atoms e.g. water and ligands
- All even for protonation to add hydrogen and all the residues, e.g. 
protonation even adjust the desired pH value

- And get the result in PDB file, however need to convert into pdbqt files.

- Using Obabel to convert seems to be the messing-up point: 
-->The formatting in the file changes (no matter it was pdbFixed before),
leads to the Unknown-Tag file error in the Vina docking

pdbfixer --pdbid=6o0k --add-residues --ph=7.4 --output=pdbfixer_74.pdb
pdbfixer --pdbid=6o0k --add-residues --ph=7.4 --verbose --keep-heterogens=none  --output=pdbfixer_74_keep_none.pdb
obabel pdbfixer_74_keep_none.pdb -xr -O pdbfixer_obable.pdbqt


!!! this didnt work
obabel -ipdb pdbfixer_74_keep_none.pdb -ppdbqt -O pdbfixer_74_keep_none.pdbqt


- In the ISOKANNtool, the MGLtools is used in for converting of receptor pdb file into pdbqt file,
instead of Obabel.


I have so much troubles to install mgltools on my mac :/
- def mgltools_receptor(input, output):
    MGLTOOLS_PATH = "mgltools_x86_64Linux2_1.5.7"
    command = f"{MGLTOOLS_PATH}/bin/pythonsh {MGLTOOLS_PATH}/MGLToolsPckgs/AutoDockTools/Utilities24/prepare_receptor4.py -r {input} -o {output}"
    result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
